    <h1>Public Health</h1>
   <p style="color:blue";>Public health is the collective effort of society to protect, promote, and improve the health and well-being of entire populations. It goes beyond individual medical care, focusing instead on prevention, education, and the creation of healthy environments. Through initiatives such as disease surveillance, vaccination programs, sanitation, nutrition awareness, and health policy development, public health works to reduce health inequalities and prevent the spread of illness. By combining science, community engagement, and effective governance, public health ensures longer, healthier lives and builds resilient societies capable of responding to both everyday health challenges and global emergencies.</p>
